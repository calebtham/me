                        <p>I am currently a University of Warwick student studying Computer Science MEng. 
                        <p>I have always been captivated by the pervasiveness of technology. Reading of the field's exciting applications at an early age spurred me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. As I started to learn how to program, I immediately fell in love with the mix of problem solving and creative thinking. Areas I'm particularly passionate about are AI/ML and full stack development. I now find myself coding for my studies, for business, and for fun!</p>
                        <p id="cv">In my spare time, I enjoy continuing to express my creative side through composing music, photography, and graphic design - even still, I find myself glued to a screen, using software such as Logic Pro and Adobe's Creative Suite. As well as this, since I love sharing my passions, I became Head of Marketing at Warwick Jazz Society.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">With PHP, JavaScript, and SQL, I implemented a chore scheduling web app, complete with a database, user authentication system, and push notifications.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-3">Users may create, edit, delete their account. A user can create or join a house, for which chores can be organised and scheduled to repeat. Chores are assigned to a member of the house and can be marked as complete.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">I implemented, in Python, a program that takes as input a set of shows and comedians for a comedy club and outputs a minimum cost timetable, using AI techniques such as simulated annealing and backtracking.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">Using C, I implemented a program that parses TCP/IP packets to detect malicious traffic. The program identifies SYN attacks, ARP poisoning attacks, and blacklisted URLs. The efficiency of the program was improved by making use of multithreaded programming (thread pool model) to process packets in parallel.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-3">Having programmed in C, I now better understand how memory in programs is managed and how important it is to write code carefully as to avoid memory leaks. Moreover, implementing a thread pool demonstrated the necessity to properly synchronize threads, such as by using mutex locks.</p>
                                        <p>This coursework was graded as a First.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-3">This coursework demonstrated to usefulness of regular expressions and helped me better appreciate the stages involved in compilation.</p>

                            <p>For my Computer Science A-Level NEA, I wanted create something that combined concepts from all the subjects that I was studying. When deciding what to implement, we had just learned the formulae for 2D collisions of objects in Further Mathematics, and so 8 Ball Pool then seemed the perfect game to implement. The program combined formulas from Physics with OOP principles from Computer Science.</p>
                            <p>The game was complete with user-friendly GUI, user options, multiplayer mode, and single player mode (with user selected difficulty).

                            <p>Having completed the Machine Learning Course (by Stanford University) on Coursera, I decided to write my own neural networks from scratch (including all Matrix operations) in VB.NET. This tested my mathematical proficiency as well as my OOP skills, which I recently just learned.</p>
                            <p>I then decided to use this ANN to learn to play the flappy bird game - of which I wrote a clone.</p>
                            <p>The ANN architecture used was simple - just five inputs (related to position and y-velocity of the bird, and position of the next pipe), one hidden layer (64 parameters), and one output (whether to jump or not).</p>
                            <p>As opposed to backpropagation, a genetic algorithm is used to train the ANN. In the initial stage of training, 1000 birds are initialised with random parameters and they simultaneously play until all the birds die. The fitness function is simple: the longer they live, the higher the score. The parents for the next stage of evolution are chosen proportionally according to their fitness, and then new birds are created by crossover of the parents. Each new bird is also subject to random mutation of its parameters.</p>
                            <p>The ANN was able to learn to play the game perfectly (without dying) in under 20 stages of training.</p>
