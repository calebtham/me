                        <p>I am a highly motivated and determined aspiring Software Engineer, currently in my third (penultimate) year studying Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Warwick. 
                        <p>I have always been captivated by the pervasiveness of technology. Reading about the field's profound impact at an early age spurred me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. As I started to learn how to program, I immediately adored the combination of problem solving and creative thinking, which only furthered to the industry's appeal. Areas I'm particularly passionate about are AI/ML and full stack development. I now find myself coding for my studies, for work (most recently as a Software Developer for <a href="https://progressive-research.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progressive Equity Research</a>), and for fun!</p>
                        <p id="cv">In my spare time, I enjoy continuing to express my creative side through composing music, photography, and graphic design - even still, I find myself glued to a screen, using software such as Logic Pro and Adobe's Creative Suite. As well as this, since I love sharing my passions, I became Head of Marketing at Warwick Jazz Society.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-3">Using C, I implemented a program that parses TCP/IP packets to detect malicious traffic. The program identifies SYN attacks, ARP poisoning attacks, and blacklisted URLs. The efficiency of the program was improved by making use of multithreaded programming (thread pool model) to process packets in parallel.</p>

Moreover, implementing a thread pool demonstrated the necessity to properly synchronize threads, such as by using mutex locks.</p>

I very much enjoy Chess, and so it seemed a sensible game to implement.</p>
                        <p>The game is complete with game settings (such as timer duration and increment), in-game chat, and ability to: request a takeback, offer a draw, resign, and ask for a rematch.</p>
                        <p>The website was created with mobile devices in mind and so can be played on-the-move. Because of this - along with the application's reliability and game flexibility - I often use this website to challenge my friends to a game of chess.</p>

                        <p>Having already completed the Machine Learning Course (by Stanford University) on Coursera and written MLPs both from scratch and in TensorFlow.js, I wanted to explore some more complex architectures - namely CNNs. So, I decided to take the "Getting started with TensorFlow 2" course on Coursera.</p>
                        <p>Using the skills obtained on the course, I created a CNN model that classifies alphanumeric characters, trained on the EMINST dataset. To prevent overfitting, I used dropout layers, batch normalization, and regularization - as well as callbacks that (i) saved the best model in training (after an epoch) and (ii) stopped training if validation accuracy had not improved in two epochs. </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">I also wrote my own custom callback that graphed, using Matplotlib, the model's prediction frequency distribution - this was to investigate how the model was learning. For example, it may be predicting 'b' much more often than '6', even though the validation set was balanced. I found that this issue was much less common with a model with regularization, batch normalization and dropout layers. Thus, this callback helped me determine the model architecture and fine-tune the hyperparameters.</p>

At the time, we had just learned the formulae for 2D collisions of spheres in Further Mathematics, and so 8 Ball Pool then seemed the perfect game to implement.

The most challenging part was implementing the single player mode AI. With pen and paper, I derived the formula to obtain which angle the AI should hit the cue ball to pocket another ball. I also developed some heuristics for the AI to decide which ball to pocket, which hole to pocket into, and what power to hit the cue ball.</p>

                        <p>Having completed the Machine Learning Course (by Stanford University) on Coursera, I decided to write my own neural networks (MLP) from scratch (including all Matrix operations) in VB.NET. This tested my mathematical proficiency as well as my OOP skills, which I recently just learned.</p>
                        <p>I then decided to use this MLP to learn to play the flappy bird game - of which I wrote a clone.</p>
                        <p>The MLP architecture used was simple - just five inputs (related to position and y-velocity of the bird, and position of the next pipe), one hidden layer (64 parameters), and one output (whether to jump or not).</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">As opposed to backpropagation, a genetic algorithm is used to train the MLP. In the initial stage of training, 1000 birds are initialised with random parameters, and they simultaneously play until all the birds die. The fitness function is simple: the longer they live, the higher the score. The parents for the next stage of evolution are chosen proportionally according to their fitness, and then new birds are created by crossover of the parents. Each new bird is also subject to random mutation of its parameters.</p>

                        <p>In VB.NET, I created a Connect 4 PC application, complete with offline multiplayer mode and single player mode. For the single player AI, I used the minimax algorithm and improved its performance with alpha-beta pruning. For this, I derived my own heuristics, and even at low depths of search (5-6) the AI was able to reliably beat my A-Level classmates.</p>
                        <p>This project was inspired by AlphaZero's achievements in beating world champions at Go. Reading about this, I wanted to explore the applications of similar AI (albeit much simpler) for myself. The project also allowed me to learn how to create a user-friendly GUI and enabled me to implement my new-found knowledge of OOP principles.</p>
                        <p>VB.NET was used since it was the language we learned in A-Level Computer Science.</p>
